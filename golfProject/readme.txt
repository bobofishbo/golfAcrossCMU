Welcome to Golf Across CMU, a golf simulator which is built upon a map of CMU terrain. 
Players are able to control the golfer's choice of clubs, direction of the shot, and power of the shot
in order to get it in the hole in the least number of shots. The different terrains will have different 
impacts on the ball, and hitting the ball into the water, the buildings, or out 
of bounds will result in penalties. Players can also use the driving rangefeature,
which allows for some practice with the controls before 
playing the actual 4-hole game.


To run the project, simply run main.py, and all the images (all hand drawn by myself, 
no usage of external sources) are included inside the zip file. There are no external libraries 
that are needed. 

The controls are the game should be simple for anyone who's played a golf game, but in case
you are unfamiliar with golf, you start off at the tee box, try to hit the ball in the light green
fairway, and onto the even lighter colored green, and putt the ball into the hole. 
Press the enter key to stop the direction bar, press the spacebar to stop the power bar,
and click on the clubs icon to change clubs. The two blue arrows at the bottom right of the top 
view are used to aim left or right. One shortcut is the 'g' key, which will allow you to
skip to the next hole, but counting the score of the current hole as 2 times the par of the hole.

Thank you for reading and please enjoy.
